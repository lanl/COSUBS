# COSUBS (COrrelated Sampling Using Batch Statistics)

COSUBS reads MCNP6 output files and uses tally fluctuation charts
(TFCs) to apply batch statistics to combinations of tallies.
The full description and user manual is published in 
Nuclear Science and Technology Open Research (NSTOR):

COSUBS has been built and tested only on a Linux platform with an Intel
FORTRAN compiler.
